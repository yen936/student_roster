## Overview 

This project is a mock migration of a university's existing student system to a new platform using C++. This part of the system is responsible for reading and manipulating the provided data. The program  containing two main classes (i.e., Student and Roster) maintains a current roster of students within a given course. Student data for the program include student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree program.
